Mostly, this is a repository for source code of my Javascript Commodore PET emulator.  The official location
for my emulator is at https://skibo.net/6502/pet2001 but having it here makes it easier to browse the source
and track changes I occasionally make:

I also have an Apple \]\[+ emulator but it is not very advanced:

I also made this page a while back to solve and create Sudoku puzzles:
