# skibo.github.io

This is mostly a repository for source code of my Javascript Commodore PET emulator.

I now have www.skibo.net redirected to here so that https://skibo.net/6502/pet2001, the original
location of the emulator, still works.  I no longer do much work with this and
Norbert Landsteiner continues to maintain his version of this emulator at https://www.masswerk.at/pet/
